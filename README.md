# Learning Tailwind
Hello today i am learning how to use tailwindcss with gatsby. I am using this resource for from the docs to get caught up with it. [Here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/gatsby) is the doc link.

This approach uses the following versions:
- gatsby-cli: 5.12.4
- tailwindcss: 3.3.5

## Process
Ive created a new directory where i plan to build a gatsby site using tailwind. This will be a blog site powered by markdown data for blog posts.

In the terminal lets create the project

```shell
gatsby new catching-tailwind
```

Going into that directory gatsby creates a starter site for us. Lets continue to follow the doc by installing the dependencies and updating the config files.

# Our goal
Our goal for this exercise is to create a few basic components that can constitute as a landing page for someone. This will be a one page landing page that has 4 sections:

- A Hero Section
- A Services Section
- A Testimonials Section
- A Contact Form at the bottom.

Of course there will also be a nav/header and a footer. Bonus points if we can fit in a recent post section that links to some recent articles that someone has.

# Header
Lets create a header which will serve as our nav for our page. The starter already includes a header.js file in our components so we'll modify that.

```jsx
import * as React from "react"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

const Header = ({ siteTitle }) => (
  <header>
    <nav className="flex flex-col shadow-md md:py-4 md:flex-row md:justify-between">
      <div><Link className="text-3xl" to="/" >
        {siteTitle}
      </Link></div>
      <div className="flex gap-4 justify-between">
        <Link className=" flex items-center" to="#services">Services</Link>
        <Link className=" flex items-center" to="#testimonials">Testimonials</Link>
        <Link className=" flex items-center" to="#contact">Contact</Link>
      </div>
    </nav>

  </header>
)

export default Header

```
At the `nav` element here we are using flex and flex-col which means the `siteTitle` and the div containing the links to other pages are displays them as a column. Then we use `md:` to specify a change in behavior for larger screens (md and above breakpoint). We change it to `flex-row` and renders the page with a row after reachinging and exceeding the medium breakpoint. In side the links for servies, contact and testimonials we needed to justify the content of the anchor tag, so here we use `flex items-center` to center the text (items inside the anchor) vertically.

Tailwind uses a mobile first approach, meaning you only apply styles at certain breakpoints and above.

## Footer
We'll take the footer element out of the pages/index.js file and create a new component called footer.

```shell
code ./src/components/footer.js
```
We'll remove the item footer from the layout and add our own
```js
import * as React from "react"

const Footer = ({ siteTitle }) => (
    <footer className="">
    {`${siteTitle}`} Â© {new Date().getFullYear()} &middot; Built with
    {` `}
    <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a>
  </footer>
)

export default Footer

```

## Hero Section
Next we are going to work on the here section which will feature some content on one side and an image on the other side. Lets create a hero-image-right.js file and 

```shell
code ./src/components/hero-image-right.js
```

Here are the contents of the file

```js
import React from "react"

const HeroImageRight = () => (
    <>
        <section className="relative">
            <div className="container flex flex-col items-center mt-4 md:mt-6 lg:mt-12 mx-auto md:flex-row-reverse ">
                {/* image on the right */}
                <div className="basis-1/2 grid justify-items-center">
                    <img className="object-cover h-48 w-96 rounded-lg shadow-md" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1444962668425-360f59fa2c24?q=80&w=1000&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"></img>
                </div>
                {/* content on left */}
                <div className="basis-1/2">
                    <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold md:text-6xl md:font-extrabold">Learning <span className="text-amber-300">Tailwind</span></h2>
                    <p>Just learning tailwind because I wanted to learn more about UI frameworks and make good looking landing pages using gatsby. Building up projects is how I best learn. How about you? Tag me @juanjuanzero and let me know!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className="hidden lg:block h-48 w-96 bg-amber-300 rounded-full absolute -right-0.5 -bottom-5 -z-10"></div>
        </section>
    </>
)

export default HeroImageRight;
```

So we add an accent dive that is positioned absolute, relative from its parent. This is why you'll see that the section has a relative className. This accent div will actually be hidden for smaller screens and only display when it hits the lg breakpoint, which sets the display block with `lg:block`. We'll want to it display the image at the top on mobile so its going to start with `flex-col` and then at the medium breakpoint we'll reverse it with `flex-col-reverse`.

## Questions
- What is postcss?
PostCss is a css processor, that compiles your css into css that works for any thing. In this case, it compiles tailwind classes you type in your files into css that you can use.
